It may measure less than 50 square miles and have a population that doesn’t even crack a million, but San Francisco justly ranks as one of the greatest cities in the world. Famous for grand-dame Victorians, cable cars, a dynamic waterfront, and a soaring golden bridge, this city truly has it all. With trend-defining cuisine ranging from Michelin-starred dining to outrageous food trucks; world-renowned symphony, ballet, theater, and opera; plus almost boundless outdoor adventures, San Francisco justifiably stands out as one of the ultimate must-visit cities on any traveler’s wish list.

The hardest part may be deciding where to go first. (Well, that and packing for the city’s famously unpredictable weather.) The Golden Gate Bridge is one of the city’s most iconic landmarks; you can walk or bike across the span to the Marin Headlands. Or stay on the San Francisco side and stroll over to the San Francisco Palace of Fine Arts, the Presidio, or Lands End, a rugged, windswept playground where you can watch for whales and check out the ruins of the Sutro Baths.

Fisherman’s Wharf beckons with its seafaring vibe and amazing seafood restaurants; look out across the water and you’ll see another fascinating destination not to be missed, Alcatraz Island. The bustling plazas of Union Square and Ghirardelli Square offer shopping and more great dining options. The city’s patchwork of distinct neighborhoods—the Mission District, Chinatown, North Beach, Haight-Ashbury, Nob Hill, and so many more—offer endless diversions both day and night.

Despite its famously steep hills, San Francisco is remarkably easy to get around. Clanging cable cars are beloved icons and a convenient way to travel between the waterfront and Union Square. Historic streetcars run along the Embarcadero with stops for Fisherman’s Wharf, the Ferry Building Marketplace, and Oracle Park, home of the Major League’s Giants baseball team. For an easy, affordable ride, look for one of hundreds of bikeshare stations and hop on a Bay Wheels bike (or ebike) and go.
